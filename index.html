          <h2>Reflection over the course of the semester</h2>
          <p>Throughout this semester, my digital literacy and the scope at which I thought that I was capable of has greatly increased. Going into this course, my digital literacy was very low. I had virtually little to no previous experience working with HTML let alone CSS, DITA, Github, and MkDocs. These were all new concepts that I struggled greatly with learning. This type of material does not come easy to me, so I relied heavily on tutorials, example material, and the advice of my fellow classmates in order to start to comprehend the material. When I started the course, I struggled with basic things such as making a Google Site or operating Powerpoint or Prezi. However, as the semester went on, my skills and subsequent confidence started to expand. My ability to follow codes and use programs such as Atom with some degree of confidence started to solidify. This came after the assignment of the first static site. There were many fantastic resources that were at my disposal. But, what I think really helped me learn was looking at my fellow classmates' work and seeing what was all possible.</p>

<p>Then, when we entered the phase of publishing the website using Github, I felt as though the groundwork was already completed. I had something to reference, and this was just another layer to build upon. Working on the client project was a very eye opening experience. It taught me how the applications that I am learning can be implemented in a real world setting. It also showed how much work goes into these types of projects. By working in collaboration with my groupmates, we were able to bounce ideas off of each other. They were also an invaluable resource to come back to when I was stuck on technical aspects of the project.</p>

<p>One of the toughest assignments was using Oxygen XML and structured authoring with DITA. While I have a good foundational understanding of basic concepts, for me, this was another beast entirely that I was unfamiliar with. While I was able to finish the project with some degree of accuracy, the whole project was challenging for me. I think that was due, in part, to having to use the Oxygen XML editor. That was a program that I have never previously used, so every application was new to me. I got very overwhelmed and frustrated, I thought that my literacy had expanded so much, and then I was back to square one.</p>

<p>But I think that is what makes technology so astounding, there are always new things to learn and knowledge to be expanded upon. No matter what level your digital literacy is at, you can always learn more and get to another level. And that is what I have realized through the course of this semester. My digital literacy has grown exponentially since the start of the semester. But there is always room for improvement and growth. And I hope to continue that growth both through my educational and professional career.
